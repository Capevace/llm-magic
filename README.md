### Contributing

At the moment, this project is not yet open for contributions, as I am in the process of writing a thesis about it. After that is done, and the published version is tagged, I may open it up for contributions, if there is interest.

However, if you have ideas, bugs or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or start a discussion anyway! Feedback is always welcome.
